## Welcome to my Github profile. My name is Sergio.

I'm passionate about data. I have the most experience in Knowledge Management, Data Management, Data Governance, and Data Quality.

### These are some of the things I enjoy playing with:


- Python 3.7+
- Github Actions
- HTML+CSS
- APIs
- Debian
- Raspberry Pi


I'm constantly going down rabbit holes on the web, which is good and bad.
