## Welcome to my Github profile. My name is Sergio.

I'm passionate about data. I have the most experience in Knowledge Management, Data Management, Data Governance, and Data Quality.

### I'm currently focusing on my [site](https://sergiomoraes.dev), which gives me a chance to practice the following:

- Python
- Github Actions
- HTML/CSS/Liquid Syntax
- Public APIs

I'm constantly going down rabbit holes on the web, which is good and bad. I enjoy tinkering with **Debian**, Google APIs, Raspberry Pi, and am now trying to learn more about Nginx web servers.

### Contact

Reach out if you have something to teach, learn, a mix of both, or just want to exchange thoughts.
My contact information is os the left panel.
